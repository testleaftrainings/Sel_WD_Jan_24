create a new project named as PageObjectModelProject
Add necessary dependencies in pom.xml file


Steps to Implement Page object model:
1.Create necessary packages 
   *base -- to have BaseClass  with common properties
   *pages --
   *packages
   *Utills

2.Create BaseClass under base package
  *Create preCondition() and postCondition() methods with necessary code
  *Declare the ChromeDriver as global variable with public access modifiers
   i.e
   public ChromeDriver driver;
   *Apply @BeforeMethod for preColndition() and @AfterMethod for postCondition()

3.Create java classes for all pages that we navigate in the application
   * 6 java classes created under pages package
4.All the pages are should extend with BaseClass
5.Create methods for each actions/ verification in the respective pages java class 
with appropriate code for each actions and verifications

6.Apply return statement for all the methods in the pages
   return this --> same pages
   new PageClass()--> for another page

7.Create a java classes for each testcase under testcases package
8. All the testcase java classes should ectend with BaseClass




Common Dataprovider:
1.Just copy the data provider code and paste in POM BaseClass
2.Copy Read Excel class and paste in POM under utills package
3.now am getting error in ReadExcel class you should check import Statement
4.We declare excelFileName as Global variable in BaseClass
    i.e
       public String excelFileName;
5.Copy Excel Folder from Existing project and paste in POM project
6.Copy @BeforeTest annotations from Existing TestNg 
7.Make sure you pass the dataprovider name in @Test annataions


parallel Execution:
1.Remove static keyword in Chrome declaration in BaseClass
   i.e 
     public static ChromeDriver driver;
  remove static:
public ChromeDriver driver;

2.Create a constructor call in each pages 
    i.e
  public LoginPage(){
		
	}

3.pass the aruguments in constructor call
i.e  
public LoginPage(ChromeDriver driver){
		
	}
 
4.Assign the driver to the global driver inside the constructor

 i.e
     public LoginPage(ChromeDriver driver){
		this.driver=driver;
	}
